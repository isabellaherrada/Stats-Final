# STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for STA 215 Final Project. I looked into different television shows and their corresponding episodes and analyzed the lengths (in minutes) of each episode, the date they were released, tone of the episode, how many writers per episode, etc. I sought out discover if there is a relation or connection between television episodes of different shows.

## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-HERRADA.R" file, which contains the code for my project. 

## **Data**
The data collected for this project was episodes from four different television shows (Suits. Only Murders in the Building, Breaking Bad, and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. I used 4 unique variables throughout my paper(Tone, Writers, Cast, Funny). The varibale tone was used to describe the general feeling of the episode. I analyzed and documented the number of writers per episode of each show. For cast, I recorded the number of cast memebers for each episode. For the varible funny, I measured to see if the characters in each episode laughed or not to determine if the episode was funny or not. 

## **Operationalization**
To operationalize number of cast, I went on IMDB.com and went episode by episode are recored based on what IMDB.com said how many cast members were in each episode. 
I did the same thing for writers, went on IMDB.com and searched to see how many writers were credited on each episode. 
To analyze the tone of each episode, I watched the episode in full and noted what the main tone/feeling was for each episode. I had a list of tones that I could pick from (inspirational, narrative, melancholic, humor, serious, irronic, romantic and somber) that would describe each epsiode best, then assigningeach tone a specific number (1-8) and noting that down. 
My final variable was funny, I measured this by looking if the characters in each episode laughed or were laughing. This would inform me if the episode itself was funny or not. I noted this as a binary varible with 0 being No and 1 being Yes.
